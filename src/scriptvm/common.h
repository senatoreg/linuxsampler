     * Abstract base class representing standard measurement units throughout

     * "Hz" (Hertz) for frequencies or "s" for "seconds". These unit types can
     * combined with metric prefixes, for instance "kHz" (kilo Hertz),
     * "us" (micro second), etc.
     *
     * Originally the script engine only supported abstract integer values for
     * controlling any synthesis parameter or built-in function argument or
     * variable. Under certain situations it makes sense though for an
     * instrument script author to provide values in real, standard measurement
     * units to provide a more natural and intuitive approach for writing
     * instrument scripts, for example by setting the frequency of some LFO
     * directly to "20Hz" or reducing loudness by "-4.2dB". Hence support for
     * standard units in scripts was added as an extension to the NKSP script
     * engine.
     *
     * So a unit consists of 1) a sequence of metric prefixes as scale factor
     * (e.g. "k" for kilo) and 2) the actual unit type (e.g. "Hz" for Hertz).
     * The unit type is a constant feature of number literals and variables, so
     * once a variable was declared with a unit type (or no unit type at all)
     * then that unit type of that variable cannot be changed for the entire
     * life time of the script. This is different from the unit's metric
     * prefix(es) of variables which may freely be changed at runtime.
